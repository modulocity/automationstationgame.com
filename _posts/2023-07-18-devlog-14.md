Hello engineers!

Before getting into the next devlog, I wanted to briefly update all of you on the state of these devlogs. You may have noticed that there are suddently a bunch more devlogs on this website. While new to the website, these devlogs (#5 - #13) are actually updates from the last 6 months that I have been sharing in the Automation Station Discord. Although these aren’t quite as in depth as some of the first devlogs on the website, they still are packed with interesting updates and offer a behind-the-scenes look at my design process. Also, by having them on the website, there is now a single place to go for development progress, which hopefully makes it easier for all of you to follow along.

Moving forward, you can expect new devlogs here on the website roughly every two weeks. I will continue to post in Discord, but these will just contain links to the website. I am also starting to post these as events on Steam and Twitter so that non-Discord members can still follow the game’s development.

## Better Belts

The belt placement system has gone through many iterations over the development of Automation Station. In my last rewrite (back in (devlog #10)[/blog/devlog-10]), I made it so that belt placement followed the cursor, making it easier to control the exact shape that is desired. While this worked great in a lot of cases, it was missing some important features. Specifically, there was no way to easily extend or connect to existing belts. But now you can start or end a drag over an existing belt to append or prepend to it.

As you can see, the starting and ending belt now tint green to make it clear that you are going to replace the existing belt. And if the existing belt has an item on it, it will be automatically transferred to the new belt. I also made a bunch of smaller changes to the belt placement logic that you can read about in the changelog notes at the end of the devlog.
