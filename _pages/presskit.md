## Description
> Explore a mysterious planet, harvest and refine resources, discover new technology, craft machines, and set up automated factories.

Automation Station is a game about automation. You'll start with nothing but soon discover raw resources to collect. Refine and craft resources into machines to automate your harvesting, refining, and crafting tasks. Eventually, you will be able to link up your machines with conveyor belts and other gadgets to create large automated assembly lines. As you scale up, you will unlock more areas of the world to find new resources and machines to improve and expand your factory.

In this game, you build your factory the way you want. You'll have access to modular pieces that can be combined in many different ways to achieve your goals. You might like to take your time designing a perfectly efficient factory. Or perhaps you prefer a quick and sloppy approach so long as it gets the job done. There is no wrong way to play.

## Features
- **DEEP CRAFTING:** Collect, refine, process, and craft new items using a variety of machines.
- **FACTORY AUTOMATION:** Use conveyor belts, arms, sensors, and other gadgets to create a fully automated factory.
- **EXPANDING WORLD:** Discover pylons that require a continuous flow of manufactured goods to power up. Once powered, the pylons will unlock additional areas of the map.
- **DISCOVERIES:** Explore the world to discover and unlock new machines. Use what you've found to expand the capabilities of your factory, allowing you to venture out further.
- **UPGRADES & VEHICLES:** Discover upgrades for your playable character or vehicles to make it easier and more enjoyable to navigate the world.

## History

I (Scott Daley) started working on Automation Station in the spring of 2020. Initially, it was just a little side project that I would spend time on after work. The game (if you could even call it that) was entirely about conveyor belts for about a year. There was a period of several weeks where a friend and I worked out a complex set of equations to describe the motion and blockages of items in a conveyor belt network. In the summer of 2020, I quit my day job as a software engineer to work full time on Automation Station.

The game has evolved quite a bit in terms of gameplay and graphics, but it has a long way to go. I am the sole developer on the game, but my brother has been helping to create an automated pipeline for building new versions of the game.
